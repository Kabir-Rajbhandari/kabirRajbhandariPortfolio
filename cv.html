    <h1>Career Objective</h1>
    <p>
      I studied Hotel Management in higher secondary education (grade-12), which
      helped me develop strong communication and customer service skills. During
      that time, I also developed a growing interest in technology and
      problem-solving. This interest motivated me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree
      in Information Technology. I am now focused on building a career in the IT
      field, where I can apply my technical skills along with the soft skills I
      gained from my previous studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I am a motivated and detail-oriented Information Technology student
      with a passion for user-centered design and web development. I am skilled
      in front-end technologies and UI/UX tools, with strong communication and
      leadership abilities. Seeking opportunities to grow and contribute to
      dynamic tech-driven environments.
